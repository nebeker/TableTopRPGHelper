		<p>I have absolutely no idea how this looks visually. I will need someone with sight to make it pretty for visual users. So I hope it at least displays. All I know is I can use the screen reader with it.</p>
		<p>The character presented under recent characters is just a test case so I can make sure everything works. The final program will pole the 5 most recently opened sheets.</p>
		<h1>Recent Characters</h1>
		<ul id="recent-characters"></ul><br>

		<p>This will not be a D&D specific app. Rather I am leaving it open to any character sheet type that has been developed. So, under New character, there will be a number of options: not just D&D as it is now.</p>
		<h1>Create New Characters</h1>
		<ul id="new_characters"></ul>
		<span id="test"></span>

		<p>After that, I want to have some Game Master Tools and a dice roller. Like maybe an initiative counter, maybe give the Game Master access to character sheets, some sort of battle map that's accessible. I dunno what all will be under Game Master Tools yet.</p>
		<p>Finally, I want to be able to connect over a network so everyone can see the dice rolled, maybe have a way to send private messages for some RP. Stuff like that.</p>
